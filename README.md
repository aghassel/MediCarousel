## Problem Statement

Every year, hospitals worldwide are facing an escalating demand for healthcare services. This increasing pressure has led to a situation where, in recent years, 90% of essential public health services globally have reported being overwhelmed, especially in developing countries. Even in Ontario, hospitals in total have repeatedly been reported to be underutilized due to staffing issues, especially among nurses.

One significant area of concern has been the rise in surgical delays, often due to staffing challenges.  Additionally, the World Health Organization has highlighted that about 11% of surgeries in low- to middle-income countries result in infections. This statistic shows the urgency for improvement in surgical procedures and hospital efficiency. 


## Pitch
We are excited to present MediCarousel, a revolutionary voice-activated surgical assistant designed to enhance surgical efficiency and sterilization. MediCarousel responds to the surgeon's voice commands to provide sterilized instruments instantly, tackling two main problems in the current healthcare system: understaffing and the risk of improper sanitization tools. 

This innovation not only maintains a higher standard of sterility but also optimizes the role of scrub nurses. With MediCarousel handling instrument delivery, scrub nurses can shift their focus to more critical tasks, such as monitoring patient vitals, or be redeployed to other vital areas like post-operative care units and intensive care units.
MediCarousel: Redefining Surgical Instrument Management through Advanced Technology

The primary benefit of MediCarousel lies in its capacity to allow surgeons to select and manipulate instruments through voice commands, thereby not only optimizing the surgical process but also maintaining a critical sterile environment. 

Furthermore, the incorporation of computer vision technology ensures the organization of surgical tools, thereby elevating the standards of safety within the operating room. 

### Voice-Activated Control in Surgical Settings
Studies have shown the reduction in physical contact with instruments during surgery has been linked to a decrease in the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs), with one study reporting a 15% reduction in SSIs (Johnson & Lee, 2024). This is particularly crucial in complex surgeries where the risk of infection is higher.

Moreover, the use of voice commands in surgery fosters a more streamlined and organized operating room. The ability to instantly call upon the needed instrument reduces the time and potential errors associated with manual selection. 

### Advances in Computer Vision for Surgical Safety
Furthermore, vision contributes significantly to the organization of surgical instruments. By automatically identifying and cataloging each tool, computer vision aids in maintaining an orderly and efficient operating room. Research indicates that this level of organization can decrease the time spent on instrument preparation and handling by up to 30%, thereby reducing overall surgical time (Williams & Patel, 2024).

In summary, the incorporation of computer vision technology in surgical environments significantly bolsters surgical safety.

## Software and Hardware Specifications

### Hardware Spec Prototype

### Hardware Spec Real life
The theoretical design would consist of several mechanisms to optimize mechanical efficiency and ensure sterility. This entire mechanism would fit in a 12 cubic inch volume.

**Steam Sterilizer**: 
The Steam Sterlizer, would consist of a prefilled water deposit, or be directly connected to a supply.  This is the most common and preferred method for sterilizing surgical instruments, especially those made of stainless steel and other heat-resistant materials. It's effective against all types of microorganisms, including spores. They would be released via a high pressure and exhaust at around 134 degrees Celsius. The excess residue would be released through the chamfered vents, and cool water would be released to cool the tool. 

**Camera & Piston**:
Once the camera detects a tool the piston will be activated to make the tool to be accessible to the surgeon.

**Gears**: 
The planetary gear system with the 8:30 gear ratio for torque ensures that the servo has enough torque to push any tool while also maintaining an optimal speed of around 60 rpm (using a 200 rpm motor).

**Adjustable plate**:
The adjustable plate is a movable plate that contains all items of the device. 

### Software Spec Product
**Voice Automation**:
A wake word was created using picovoice through their porcupine API. After the wake word is detected, the following few seconds of audio are recorded, inputting the recording into the Whisper through the OpenAI API for transcription. This output is passed into the device to determine the rotation.

**Computer Vision**:
After capturing the image and transferring it to a the laptop server, the image is passed into the GPT-Vision API. The output is passed into Whisper for text-to-speech functionality, outputting audio instructions.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook
MediCarousel is pioneering steps in hospital efficiency and optimization with an overall goal of providing better healthcare to the world. Our team would wish to continue this project beyond this hackathon and implement it to help improve our healthcare system with the following timeline:

In conclusion, MediCarousel is not just a testament to current technological capabilities but a beacon for future innovations in the surgical field. As we step forward into this new era, the integration of such advanced systems is poised to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in surgical precision and patient care.
